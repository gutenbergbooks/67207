<p>(Little Boo-Hoo—Is it Y-O-U?)</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“What shall I do</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For Little Boo-Hoo?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">cried mother one day.</p>

<p>Her little boy cried when he had his
face washed, and cried when he had to get
up, and cried when he had to go to bed,
and cried when he went to school, or
stubbed his toe, or lost a game of ball.</p>

<p>Little Fairy Light-Heart whispered to
mother,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I can help you soon it seems,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I’ll take him to the land of dreams.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<p>Before you could wink an eye-lash little
Boo-Hoo was nid-nid-nodding, and in the
twinkling of an eye Fairy Light-Heart said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The desert country is new to you,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We’ll travel together, Little Boo-Hoo!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Little Boo-Hoo rubbed his eyes.</p>

<p>He was standing on a sand pile sure
enough, and there were fairies all around
him.</p>

<p>They were not fairies with happy, smiling
faces, but they frowned and scolded
while Fairy Long-Face cried,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Little Boo-Hoo has cried for years,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He soon will be dissolved in tears!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the most surprising thing happened!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<p>Four and twenty little fairies came running
with four and twenty little empty
gold-fish bowls and Fairy Growly-Voice
said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Really we don’t mean to tease, Sir,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Will you cry each bowl full please, Sir?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Elves and Fairies were very short
of water in their desert home!</p>

<p>Before Little Boo-Hoo could shed a tear,
Elf Big-Frown led a whole bucket brigade
and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Come, cry our buckets full for fun,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then we can get our washing done.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>All the fairies set up a chorus,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“A bucket full, come cry with pleasure,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Little Boo-Hoo give good measure.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p>Then Fairy Contrary said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Come cry a pond full, for we think</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We’ll freeze it for a skating rink.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Just as Little Boo-Hoo began to feel a
tiny little bit scared under his left hand
vest coat pocket, Fairy Light-Heart, who
had left only for a minute, skipped first on
one foot then on the other singing,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“In a hole, high in the tree,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">See the little Wishing Key!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Little Boo-Hoo looked above him, on a
branch hung a little key.</p>

<p>He took it in his chubby little fingers
and read on the key,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“If you travel miles and miles,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Perhaps you’ll find the Box of Smiles.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p>Then the dimples began to play about
his mouth, and because the fairy verse
mentioned “miles” he thought as likely as
not, the Box of Smiles might be near, for
the fairies enjoy a joke!</p>

<p>He put his hand in the hole in a hollow
tree beside him, and out came the
Box of Smiles.</p>

<p>On the box was written,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The Box of Smiles before you see,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Open with your Wishing Key.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He put the key in the lock.</p>

<p>It turned with a click, click, click.</p>

<p>Out flew the smiles!</p>

<p>Big smiles, little smiles, middle-sized
smiles,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Smiles to fit most any face,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Smiles for every time and place!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The fairies formed a magic ring and
danced around Little Boo-Hoo, and while
he was with them he never shed a tear!
Every one smiled, and smiled.</p>

<p>Fairy Light-Heart took Little Boo-Hoo’s
hand and they danced away, away, away, and
when he awoke it was the dawn of day,
and there hung the Wishing Key on a
little blue ribbon, round his neck.</p>

<p>Whether he ever found the Box of
Smiles again or not I do not know, but
he was always dimpling and smiling and
speaking of fairy gold-fish bowls, and wondering
if the fairies ever got their washing
done, and talking about fairies skating on
a pond.</p>

<p class="noindent">sang the Fairy Shoemakers as Little June
ran through the woods one day.</p>

<p>She stopped and listened and heard the
fairy hammers, but she could not see where
the fairies were hidden.</p>

<p>Little June looked down at her worn
out slippers and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I’d like new slippers, I’d like new shoes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of every color, if I could choose.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>She went on to the store, with a basket<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
on her arm, for she was the little errand
girl of the family.</p>

<p>As she came back home through the
woods, she heard someone singing,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“A rat, a tat, tat, a rat, a tat, too,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We are making a little red slipper for you.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Little June looked under the broad leaves
about her path, and under the toad-stools,
but she could not see where the voice
came from.</p>

<p>Every day she ran out and did errands
willingly, and only once did she complain
to her mother about her shabby slippers.</p>

<p>Mother put little bows of ribbon on the
shabby slippers to cover the worn part,
and she said everything cost so much this
year June would have to wait for a new
pair.</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>One day June went on her way sadly,
for one little toe showed through one little
slipper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<p>By and by as she sat down on a log to
rest two little tears began to trickle down
her cheeks.</p>

<p>At that very minute a little fairy jumped
right on the little toe, that peeped out
from the little slipper, singing,</p>

June had bright eyes and she threaded it
while the Fairy sang,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“A rat, a tat, tat, a rat, a tat, too,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I make silver slippers with buckles new.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then June knew that she was talking
to one of the Fairy Shoemakers and she
said,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh Fairy Shoemaker if you choose,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Could you make me slippers or shoes?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Fairy pretended he did not hear,
but he blew a silver whistle, and four and
twenty little Fairy Shoemakers came, with
their four and twenty little needles and
one after another, they asked the little
girl to thread them.</p>

<p>As they hopped about her, she never
dreamed that they might be measuring her
feet for a pair of slippers.</p>

<p>One of the Fairies hopped right up in
her lap, saying,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“A rat, a tat, tat, a rat, a tat, too,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We heard you were crying, oh was it true?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Little June said, “How would you feel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
if you were in a performance to be given
the last day of school, and what if you
had to dance in the front row, with an
old pair of slippers on?”</p>

<p>At that, the Fairy Shoemakers all sang
in a chorus,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“A rat, a tat, tat, a rat, a tat, too,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And in the front row, that will never do.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Little June did not know that she had
been dreaming in the woods that Saturday
morning, until she felt a gentle tap on her
shoulder, and there stood her teacher before
her.</p>

<p>Little June cried again and told her
teacher all her troubles, and her teacher
said, “I love the fairies too, hark! what is
that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span></p>

<p>They both heard the fairy song,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“A rat, a tat, tat, a rat, a tat, too,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We are making little red slippers for you.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Little June went merrily homeward.</p>

<p>The last day of school drew nearer and
nearer.</p>

<p>The little slippers grew more and more
shabby!</p>

<p>At last the great day came, and mother
said she was sorry she had no new slippers
for the willing little feet.</p>

<p>She said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I’m sorry when the day is here,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No coins are in my purse, I fear.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Little June sat down and sang,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I need new slippers, I think it funny,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I know no way of making money.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Evening came, and she put on the little
white dress she had ironed herself, and the
little red sash and hair ribbons father had
given her.</p>

<p>She looked at the little old slippers, with
patches upon them. They had been carefully
blackened.</p>

<p>At that very minute the door-bell went,
“Tinkle, tinkle, tinkle.”</p>

<p>She ran downstairs in her stocking feet.</p>

<p>There, on the door-step was a box marked,
“For June.”</p>

<p>With trembling fingers she opened it,
and took out a pair of little red slippers.</p>

<p>They were exactly the right size.</p>

<p>They had gilt buckles upon them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<p>Little June was so happy she danced the
best of any one, she had to come out by
and by all alone, in her little red slippers
and dance for an encore.</p>

<p>The people said it was the prettiest little
performance they had ever seen, and Little
June knew that it was a fairy dance, and
that she had learned it from the Fairy
Shoemakers who measured her for a pair
of slippers.</p>

<p>Even as she danced she thought she heard
their fairy hammers ringing, and their fairy
voices singing,</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Once upon a time, there was a little boy
who always told tales, and always tattled
on his playmates at school.</p>

<p>On Halloween night, a big Jack O’ Lantern
appeared on the window-sill of his
room, and called out of its crooked mouth,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Tell-Tale and Tattle-Too,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It’s Halloween, we’ve come for you.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<p>The little boy replied,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I am a Tell-Tale, I’ve heard said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That you are just a pumpkin head.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At this very minute, a Black Cat jumped
up on the window-sill, winking and blinking
her great round eyes, and she said, as
she showed her white teeth,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Tell-Tale and Tattle-Too,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It’s Halloween, we’ve come for you.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The little boy answered,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I am Tell-Tale, on Halloween,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I hear Black Cats are often seen.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then, whisk, bound, without any warning,
a witch on a broom rode right up on
the window-sill and shouted,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Tell-Tale and Tattle-Too,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p>As she said the last word, the wind blew,
“Ooo-ooo-” and it blew the little boy right
on the witch’s broom stick and they blew
away, away, away.</p>

<p>The Jack O’ Lantern and big Black Cat
had to run as fast as they could to keep up.</p>

<p>By and by they sailed down, down, down
into the heart of the deep green woods.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Brownies dance on Halloween,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tripping lightly o’er the green.</div>

</div>

<p>There were Brownies sure enough, dancing
in a circle. They waved their hands
and made comical faces singing.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Tell-Tale and Tattle-Too,</div>

</div>

<p>Before he knew it, the little boy was
dancing round and round the ring with the
Brownies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span></p>

<p>He was all out of breath when they
stopped dancing and the Jack O’ Lantern
said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“He tells tales as a rule,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On the playground or in school.”</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>The Black Cat said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“He tip-toes in without a noise,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And tells tales on girls and boys.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Witch said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Tell-Tale Tattlers are a trouble,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the kettle, let him bubble.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Brownies said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“We will test him in the woods,</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<p>They all began to dance around a big
kettle, that hung over the fire. The Brownies
covered their eyes and the Jack O’ Lantern
dropped a candle in the kettle. The
Black Cat dropped in catnip and the witch
dropped in two straws from her broom.</p>

<p>Then the Brownies uncovered their eyes
and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Tell-Tale and Tattle-Too,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tell us what did Jack O’ Lantern do?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Tell-Tale put his hand over his mouth
for he wanted to whisper, “He dropped in
a candle, and it will spoil your kettle of
soup,” but he sat stock-still and never said
a word.</p>

<p>Then the Brownies winked and blinked
at each other as they said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Tell-Tale and Tattle-Too,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tell us what did the Black Cat do?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span></p>

<p>Tell-Tale put both hands over his mouth
this time for he wanted to sing out, “She
put catnip in the kettle and it will spoil
your porridge,” but he smiled to himself and
never answered a word.</p>

<p>Then the Brownies clapped their hands
as much as to say, “We’ve got him this
time,” and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Tell-Tale and Tattle-Too,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tell us what did the old Witch do?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The little boy turned a backward somersault
for he wanted to shout, “She put two
straws in the kettle and it will spoil your
stew,” but he said never a word.</p>

<p>Then the most surprising thing happened.</p>

<p>The candle jumped out of the kettle and
said,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Tell-Tale and Tattle-Too,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is not a good name now for you.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the candle jumped into a beautiful
Halloween lantern and stood by his side,
while the catnip jumped out of the kettle
and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Tell-Tale and Tattle-Too,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Such a name will never do.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the catnip began to weave this way
and that way, till it wove a beautiful carriage
for the little boy to ride home in.</p>

<p>Out jumped the two straws from the kettle
and sang,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Tell-Tale and Tattle-Too,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Think a minute, is it you?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The straws turned into two coal-black<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
steeds and were ready to draw the beautiful
carriage.</p>

<p>The lantern lighted their way, and saying
good bye to the Jack O’ Lantern, the
Big Black Cat, and Witch, he drove merrily
homeward.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">As a Halloween joke,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Just then he awoke.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He saw a Halloween lantern in the moon-light.
It hung above the window-sill and as
it turned round and round, he saw on it
a Jack O’ Lantern, a Big Black Cat and a
Witch!</p>

<p>He cried,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“’Tis a magic lantern, if I were in it,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I’d change my name to Think-A-Minute.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Whether he rode in the magic lantern or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
not, I cannot say, but every year on Halloween
a Big Black Cat, sat on his door-step,
and a Jack O’ Lantern peeped in his
window, and a Witch riding by on a broom
said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Think-A-Minute, how do you do?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis Halloween, we’ve come for you.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He had many jolly rides with the trio
many times on Halloween without doubt.</p>

<p>I wish I knew if he really changed his
name to “Think-A-Minute.” I forgot to
ask him.</p>

<p>If Little Stay-At-Home had not found a
red, white and blue pin on the 4th of July
perhaps nothing fairylike would have happened.</p>

<p>She said to herself over and over,</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The children going to the Fourth of
July celebration waved their hands to her
and called, “Goodbye, Little Stay-At-Home,
good-bye.”</p>

<p>Little Stay-At-Home knew that mother
needed her at home, and she knew that
the ironing had to be done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span></p>

<p>As she got out the Clothes Horse she
heard a voice call.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Red, white and blue is your pin I see,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Why don’t you make wishes, one, two, three?”</div>

<p>Then the Ironing Board piped up,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">“Red, white and blue for the Fourth of July</div>

<p>The Iron acted in the strangest manner

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0">“Fairies grant wishes by and by,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hurrah, hurrah, for the Fourth of July.”</div>

<p>Little Stay-At-Home had never happened
to see kitchen things act in such a comical
manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span></p>

<p>She stood first on one foot, then on the
other and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh little pin red, white and blue</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I want peanut bags, and fire crackers too.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the first surprising thing happened.</p>

<p>A Peanut Bag sailed in the window and
the Peanut Fairies sailed about as lively
as crickets. They sprinkled and folded the
clothes neatly.</p>

<p>Little Stay-At-Home clapped her hands
and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh little pin do not delay</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I’d like more help on ironing day.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the second surprising thing happened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span></p>

<p>A Firecracker walked in proudly, jumped
up on the Ironing Board and began to
iron clothes as neatly as you please.</p>

<p>A cracked voice called,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ha, ha, ha, let’s work together,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Minding not the time nor weather.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Little Stay-At-Home began to iron on the
table, and the Firecracker ironed on the
board. My! how fast the work went on.</p>

<p>Suddenly the little girl remembered she
had one more wish so she said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“To finish my work I always try,</div>

</div>

<p>Then the third surprising thing happened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span></p>

<p>In floated a red, white, and blue balloon
with a basket below it, to ride in.</p>

<p>The Peanut Fairies jumped in the basket.</p>

<p>The Firecracker jumped in and Little
Stay-At-Home jumped in beside him.</p>

<p>They sailed away to the Fourth of July
celebration.</p>

<p>The Fireworks had not arrived.</p>

<p>Little Stay-At-Home wondered if she
could have one more wish, so she rubbed
her little Wishing Pin and wished that the
Fireworks would come at once.</p>

<p>To the delight of all, they arrived and
everyone shouted, “Hurrah, for the Fourth
of July!”</p>

<p>After the Fireworks were over and the
red lemonade was passed the strange company<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
in the basket sailed right back in the
kitchen window.</p>

<p>A sweet voice called,</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Mother stood in the doorway with a
glass of red lemonade on a tray, and a dish
of white ice cream, and cakes covered with
red and blue sugar.</p>

<p>Little Stay-At-Home rubbed her sleepy
eyes, her adventure seemed very real, and
sure enough the ironing was all done!</p>

<p>Little Stay-At-Home and mother sat down
to enjoy their treat. She told mother her
adventures.</p>

<p>She put her hand to her dress.</p>

<p>The Wishing Pin was gone.</p>

<p>They next saw a white balloon sail over
the house and a fiery voice called,</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">“If you’re good I’ll help you by and by</div>

</div>

<p>The Firecracker sailed away in his balloon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<p>Then a blue balloon sailed over the house

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Wishing Pin dropped right down
into Little Stay-At-Home’s hand!</p>

<p>She called,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Hurrah, for balloons that sail on high</div>

may make three wishes every day.</p>

<p>Little Girl Throw-Away was always throwing
something away from morning until
night.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“She threw away paper, she threw away string</div>

</div>

<p>The little girl said, “I don’t believe in

<p>Then the most surprising thing happened.</p>

<p class="caption">THE LITTLE FAIRY FROM THRIFT TOWN
STEPPED OUT <span class="smaller">(<a href="#Page_50"><i>See page 50</i></a>)</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span></p>

<p>The Thrifty Fairies sailed in the window
and tugged at the little girl’s dress and
apron, and soon they carried her away,
away, away to Thrift Town.</p>

<p>There every one was smiling and happy
and every one was talking about saving
something.</p>

<p>They called in merry little voices,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Save to-day, save to-morrow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then you’ll never have to borrow.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Thrifty people were very, very small
and looked like real fairies. One little
Fairy called,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I’d make a four-poster bed to-day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If I had your pencils, Girl Throw-Away.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Little Girl Throw-Away looked in her
dress pocket and apron pocket, but she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
could not find any pencils at all. Then
the Fairy said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I like paper sheets, you think it funny,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But they would save me lots of money.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then Little Girl Throw-Away, sighed,
“Oh dear, oh dear, I do throw away things
so much, I never save my paper, I never
write on both sides of a sheet.”</p>

<p>The Fairy next said in a sing-song kind
of way,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I would be glad of everything,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If I only had a ball of string.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>She would not tell anyone what she
wanted the string for.</p>

<p>By and by the Thrifty Fairies took Little
Girl Throw-Away home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span></p>

<p>She sat in her little red rocking chair
and said, “I cannot see the Fairies now,
but I will begin to save for them!”</p>

<p>So she saved her little bits of pencils
and paper and string, and laid them in a
little box on the window-sill every night,
and every morning they were gone.</p>

<p>She saved all the paper bags too, that
came to the house for the Fairies.</p>

<p>By and by at the end of a year and a
day, she saw a Fairy balloon.</p>

<p>It sailed down, down, down, and the little
Fairy from Thrift Town stepped out
and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Our balloon is made of your paper and string</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And kites too we have made, and everything.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span></p>

<p>She gave Little Girl Throw-Away a tiny
little white box. On opening it, the Little
Girl found a tiny gold ring with a forget-me-not
upon it. Inside the ring was written,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Save a bit every day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Help the fairies in their play.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Waving her hand gayly the little Fairy
stepped back into her balloon and sailed
away, away, away to Thrift Town.</p>

<p>Little Girl Throw-Away put her ring on
her third finger and wished it on, saying,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I am Save-A-Bit, you understand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For I have been to Fairyland!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Soon every little girl in town was saving
paper, and pencils and strings, and I think
the Fairies must often have dropped things
down to them from their gay balloons, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
the children wore happy smiles and talked
in a fairy language.</p>

<p>They sang fairy songs too,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Think, before you throw away,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That’s what all the fairies say,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And that’s what makes their life worthwhile.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Little Girl Throw-Away became a very
thrifty child and sometimes she talked in
fairy rhymes.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I’m very glad the fairies came,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Little Girl changed her name to
“Girl Save-A-Bit,” and many a time she
played with the Fairies from Thrift Town.</p>

<p>Little Boy lived with such old people

<p>Before the pennies could be changed
into dimes or answer a word, and before
Little Boy could get into bed, (for it was
his sleepy time) “pitter, patter, pitter, patter”
was heard on the staircase and up
came Fairy Good-Cheer, saying,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I need a Birthday Cake I fear,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Fairies had always been so good to
Little Boy that he emptied his pockets of
the pennies he had saved for his own

off singing,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span></p>

<p>Little Boy saved up his pennies again for
a week and a day and said,</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">“Little pennies round and bright,</div>

<p>Before the pennies could answer a word,
“pitter, patter pitter, patter,” was heard on
the staircase and up came Fairy Light-Heart

<p>Once more Little Boy saved his pennies

<p>He put his hand up to his ear to listen.</p>

<p>Sure enough, again he heard, “pitter,

Sing-Song, singing,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“All I need is a musical top,</div>

</div>

<p>As Little Boy counted out his twenty-three
pennies she went off singing,</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Little Boy sighed after the Fairies left
him and he went out and sat down on his
own staircase saying,</p>

<p>Then the enchanted staircase on which
he was sitting cried,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Just go to the bottom, look up and see,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Fairies surprise both you and me.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Little Boy ran down stairs and looked
up.</p>

<p>He saw on the tip top step a wonderful
Birthday Cake. It was large and round
and had pink and white frosting upon it.</p>

<p>Just then a cheerful voice called,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Fairy Good-Cheer makes no mistake,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She has sent to you a Birthday Cake.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then, as Little Boy winked and blinked
his eyes to be sure he was not dreaming, a
laughing voice called,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Fairy Light-Heart brings the candles,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">More than one Boy ever handles.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p>There shone candles on every step, big
candles, little candles, middle-sized candles,
Birthday Candles, red, white and blue
candles, ready to light the Birthday Cake.</p>

<p>Then he saw boxes, and boxes of candy,
while a sugary voice cried,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Fairy Sweet-Tooth pile them higher,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of candy, small Boys never tire.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Little Boy laughed so hard that he rolled
right over in a heap on the floor, for the
Fairy piled candy right up to the ceiling.</p>

<p>Then a Musical Top began to spin down
the staircase singing,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Fairy Sing-Song’s smile is winning,</div>

happened.</p>

<p>The top step of the enchanted staircase
opened.</p>

<p>The Birthday Cake led the way.</p>

<p>The lighted candles went two and two,
and the candy boxes followed, while all the

<p>In less time than it takes to tell it, the

<p>Dot said, “I can hardly wait for night,
I want to see how you give children courage.”</p>

<p>Dwarf Courage said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Miss Dorothy Delia Drusilla Dot,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Night time will come as like as not.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At last evening came, and they started
out in cap and gown, Dwarf Courage saying,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“We’ll have to hurry, for it’s said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some children fear to go to bed.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>What fun they had when they came to
town, running up one staircase, after another,
helping the children to go happily to bed.</p>

<p>One little boy was afraid after he had
gotten to bed and Dwarf Courage pulled
aside the curtain and showed him the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
friendly moon and he went happily to
sleep.</p>

<p>One little girl was afraid to stay alone in
the dark and Dwarf Courage cried,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The clock is company for you,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Just hear it sing “Cuckoo, cuckoo.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Dot said, “I never thought before what
little ’fraid cats some children are.”</p>

<p>At this, Dwarf Courage turned a backward
somersault down the stairs and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Honestly Dot, I will tell you,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There are some grown folks scarey too.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They had hardly gotten outside when
they saw an old man walking in the moon-light,
“See,” said Dot. “He is really afraid
of falling.”</p>

<p>Dot took one hand and Dwarf Courage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
the other and soon the old man was safe
at home.</p>

<p>As they ran along giving every one
courage, Dwarf Courage sang,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“They’re scared of rats and scared of mice</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And often scared of things quite nice,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They’re scared at morning, night and noon,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They’re scared of faces in the moon,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh tell me, what would people do,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If Little Dwarf Courage were scarey too?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They ran along through the woods and
some one was singing,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Umbrellas to lend, but none to sell,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Umbrellas to mend, come ring my bell.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The rain was falling, “patter, patter, patter,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
and they surely needed an umbrella.</p>

<p>Dot said, “Where is the house?”</p>

<p>Dwarf Courage answered,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Look for the house, look in the tree,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There, a funny old man should be.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They looked up and saw a cute little
house in a tree and an old man stood at
the door with umbrellas in each hand.</p>

<p>Dwarf Courage cried,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“See, old, man, we’ve come to borrow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We’ll return them both to-morrow.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Without a word in reply down sailed two
little fairy umbrellas, and as Dot took one
and Dwarf Courage took the other, they
sailed right through the air to the little wee
house in the woods, and Dwarf Laughter
had a merry ha, ha, as they sailed in the
open window.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Little Dorothy Marjorie Ann,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Do be thankful if you can,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">called a wee little voice one wintry November
evening.</p>

<p>Then a wee little red boot was seen
coming down the chimney, and another
little red boot, and one of the Wee
People soon was skipping merrily on the
hearth.</p>

<p>He danced himself nearly out of breath
singing,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I’m a wee little man from far away,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I’ll help you keep Thanksgiving Day.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span></p>

<p>At this, Dorothy Marjorie Ann scowled
and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I’ve nothing to be thankful for,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I think I mentioned that before.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the most surprising thing happened.</p>

<p>The Wee Little Man blew a whistle, and
the Wee People came tumbling down the
chimney, one after another, and the most
remarkable thing of all was, not one had
a speck of soot on his clothing.</p>

<p>All the fairies were scolding.</p>

<p>The Wee Bed-Time Fairy sang,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I’m thankful when you go to bed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For I am such a sleepy-head.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Mirror Fairy said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I’d be thankful you understand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If you liked to wash face and hands.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span></p>

<p>The Rubber Fairy in the hall began:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“You know we often spoke before,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We’re thankful when we’re off the floor.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Toy Fairy called,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“We may be thankful once again,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But spent last night, out in the rain.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The School Bell Fairy sang,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I’d be thankful as a rule,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If you liked to go to school.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Waste-Basket Fairy said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I’d be thankful since you ask it</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If you would notice me—the basket.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Good-Mannered Fairy sang,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“We will be thankful when Dorothy’s able</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To keep her elbows off the table.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span></p>

<p>At that, Dorothy Marjorie Ann danced
and capered about for she had no idea before,
that she had anything to do with
making the Wee People thankful, and
every hour it grew nearer, and nearer
Thanksgiving Day.</p>

<p>Soon all the Fairies were dancing and
shouting,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“We’re thankful that Dorothy Marjorie Ann,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Will try to be happy whenever she can.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the Wee Little Man who first came
down the chimney joined hands with her,
and they danced up the chimney, off and
away, over hill and dale, and all the Wee
Fairy People followed them.</p>

<p>Soon they came to a little Wee House.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span></p>

<p>The table was set for Thanksgiving
dinner. Dorothy Marjorie Ann said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“If I were a maiden like Fairies Wee,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh my! how thankful then I’d be.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>She did not notice that the Little Wee
Man had put his wishing cap on her head,
and as they ran on, she began to grow
smaller, and smaller, and smaller.</p>

<p>They ran all round the house, and the
Fairies crowded round her and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Dorothy Marjorie Ann we see,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Has grown so little, she’s wee, wee.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Fairies snatched off the wishing cap
just in time or there would have been no
Dorothy Marjorie Ann left at all!</p>

<p>They all trooped in to dinner, and every
hour it grew nearer and nearer Thanksgiving
Day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span></p>

<p>They sat at a table and Dorothy Marjorie
Ann clapped her hands as down sailed some
sliced turkey on her plate.</p>

<p>At this very minute the Wee People set
up a cry,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Take it away, take it away,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She does not like Thanksgiving Day.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Away sailed the turkey, plate and all.</p>

<p>Down sailed a fine piece of pumpkin pie
on her plate.</p>

<p>Just as she put her fork into it the Wee
People clapped their hands and sang,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“We’ll do this to Dorothy Marjorie Ann,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We’ll put her in the baking pan,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She looks rosy, nice and sweet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And almost good enough to eat,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We think we’ll take her far away,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And have a fine Thanksgiving Day.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span></p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Take it away, take it away,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She makes no one thankful here to-day.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The plate sailed away as before.</p>

<p>Down came a plate with cranberry sauce
and cookies, but she had not even taken a
bite when the Wee People called,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Take it away, take it away,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She’s never thankful we heard her say.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Away sailed the plate, and Dorothy Marjorie
Ann was so disappointed, that she ran
to the door and put on her wishing cap
and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“That dinner was a great surprise,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I want to be the proper size.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>She grew just as big as she was before,
and the Little People crowded around her
and tugged at her dress singing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span></p>

<p>At this very minute Uncle Phil came to
the rescue, singing,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“My little girl you took a nap,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In Uncle’s funny smoking cap.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Dorothy Marjorie Ann winked and blinked
her eyes; sure enough she did have a funny
cap on, and she cried,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I am more thankful than I can say,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That I came home for Thanksgiving Day.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Where have you been?” asked Father
as they sat down to eat turkey and pie and
cranberry sauce.</p>

<p>“Where have you been?” asked Mother.</p>

<p>Dorothy Marjorie Ann said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I am thankful as can be,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I don’t live with people Wee.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span></p>

<p>Uncle Phil knew a few things himself
about the Wee People so he said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“She went over the bridge I understand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And met the Wee People in Fairyland.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>After that Dorothy Marjorie Ann found
101 things to be thankful for and made
all the Wee People thankful.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I am Dorothy Marjorie Ann,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I’ll do all the good every day I can,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When I work or play, I’ll always say</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I am thankful for Thanksgiving Day.”</div>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
